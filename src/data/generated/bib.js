        "abstract": "The effectiveness of traditional incident detection is often limited by sparse sensor coverage, and reporting incidents to emergency response systems is labor-intensive. We propose to mine tweet texts to extract incident information on both highways and arterials as an efficient and cost-effective alternative to existing data sources. This paper presents a methodology to crawl, process and filter tweets that are accessible by the public for free. Tweets are acquired from Twitter using the REST API in real time. The process of adaptive data acquisition establishes a dictionary of important keywords and their combinations that can imply traffic incidents (TI). A tweet is then mapped into a high dimensional binary vector in a feature space formed by the dictionary, and classified into either TI related or not. All the TI tweets are then geocoded to determine their locations, and further classified into one of the five incident categories. We apply the methodology in two regions, the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Metropolitan Areas. Overall, mining tweets holds great potentials to complement existing traffic incident data in a very cheap way. A small sample of tweets acquired from the Twitter API cover most of the incidents reported in the existing data set, and additional incidents can be identified through analyzing tweets text. Twitter also provides ample additional information with a reasonable coverage on arterials. A tweet that is related to TI and geocodable accounts for approximately 5% of all the acquired tweets. Of those geocodable TI tweets, 60\u201370% are posted by influential users (IU), namely public Twitter accounts mostly owned by public agencies and media, while the rest is contributed by individual users. There is more incident information provided by Twitter on weekends than on weekdays. Within the same day, both individuals and IUs tend to report incidents more frequently during the day time than at night, especially during traffic peak hours. Individual tweets are more likely to report incidents near the center of a city, and the volume of information significantly decays outwards from the center.",

        "abstract": "The safety of signalized intersections has traditionally been evaluated at an aggregate level by relating historical collision records for several years to the annual tra\ufb03c volume and the geometric characteristics of the intersection. This is a reactive and macroscopic approach that gives little insight into how important dynamic signal cycle-related variables can affect intersection safety such as the arrival type and the shock wave characteristics. The objective of this study is to develop traffic conflict-based real-time safety models for signalized intersections using several state-of-the-art techniques. Traffic conflicts were measured by multiple indicators including time-to-collision (TTC), modified time-to-collision (MTTC), and deceleration rate to avoid collision (DRAC). Traffic conflict rate was employed as independent variable while traffic volume, queue length, shock wave area, shock wave speed, and platoon ratio of each cycle were used as covariates in the safety models. Four candidate Tobit models were developed and compared under the Bayesian framework: conventional Tobit model, grouped random parameters Tobit (GRP-Tobit) model, random intercept Tobit (RI-Tobit) model, and random parameters Tobit (RP-Tobit) model. The results showed that the GRP-Tobit model performs best with lowest Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), indicating that accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity across sites can significantly improve the model fit. The model estimation results showed that higher conflict rates were associated with various shock wave characteristics (positive sign for shock wave area, shock wave speed, and queue length) and higher traffic volume. Lower conflict rates were related with higher platoon ratio (favorable arrival patterns). The developed models can have potential applications in real-time safety evaluation, real-time optimization of signal control, and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) trajectories planning.",

        "abstract": "Proactive traffic safety management systems can monitor traffic conditions in real-time, identify the formation of unsafe traffic dynamics, and implement suitable interventions to bring unsafe conditions back to normal traffic situations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor fusion and algorithms have brought about the introduction of a proactive safety management system closer to reality. The basic prerequisite for developing such a system is to have a reliable crash prediction model that takes real-time traffic data as input and evaluates their association with crash risk. Since the early 21st century, several studies have focused on developing such models. Although the idea has considerably matured over time, the endeavours have been quite discrete and fragmented at best because the fundamental aspects of the overall modelling approach substantially vary. Therefore, a number of transitional challenges have to be identified and subsequently addressed before a ubiquitous proactive safety management system can be formulated, designed and implemented in real-world scenarios. This manuscript conducts a comprehensive review of existing real-time crash prediction models with the aim of illustrating the state-of-the-art and systematically synthesizing the thoughts presented in existing studies in order to facilitate its translation from an idea into a ready to use technology. Towards that journey, it conducts a systematic review by applying various text mining methods and topic modelling. Based on the findings, this paper ascertains the development pathways followed in various studies, formulates the ubiquitous design requirements of such models from existing studies and knowledge of similar systems. Finally, this study evaluates the universality and design compatibility of existing models. This paper is, therefore, expected to serve as a one stop knowledge source for facilitating a faster transition from the idea of real-time crash prediction models to a real-world operational proactive traffic safety management system.",

        "abstract": "Crash Detection is essential in providing timely information to traffic management centers and the public to reduce its adverse effects. Prediction of crash risk is vital for avoiding secondary crashes and safeguarding highway traffic. For many years, researchers have explored several techniques for early and precise detection of crashes to aid in traffic incident management. With recent advancements in data collection techniques, abundant real-time traffic data is available for use. Big data infrastructure and machine learning algorithms can utilize this data to provide suitable solutions for the highway traffic safety system. This paper explores the feasibility of using deep learning models to detect crash occurrence and predict crash risk. Volume, Speed and Sensor Occupancy data collected from roadside radar sensors along Interstate 235 in Des Moines, IA is used for this study. This real-world traffic data is used to design feature set for the deep learning models for crash detection and crash risk prediction. The results show that a deep model has better crash detection performance and similar crash prediction performance than state of the art shallow models. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for crash risk prediction using data 1-minute, 5-minutes and 10-minutes prior to crash occurrence. It was observed that is hard to predict the crash risk of a traffic condition, 10\u202fmin prior to a crash.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve traffic safety on expressways, it is important to develop proactive safety management strategies with consideration for segment types and traffic flow states because crash mechanisms have some differences by each condition. The primary objective of this study is to develop real-time crash risk prediction models for different segment types and traffic flow states on expressways. The mainline of expressways is divided into basic segment and ramp vicinity, and the traffic flow states are classified into uncongested and congested conditions. Also, Korean expressways have irregular intervals between loop detector stations. Therefore, we investigated on the effect and application of the detector stations at irregular intervals for the crash risk prediction on expressways. The most significant traffic variables were selected by conditional logistic regression analysis which could control confounding factors. Based on the selected traffic variables, separate models to predict crash risk were developed using genetic programming technique. The model estimation results showed that the traffic flow characteristics leading to crashes are differed by segment type and traffic flow state. Especially, the variables related to the intervals between detector stations had a significant influence on crash risk prediction under the uncongested condition. Finally, compared with the single model for all crashes and the logistic models used in previous studies, the proposed models showed higher prediction performance. The results of this study can be applied to develop more effective proactive safety management strategies for different segment types and traffic flow states on expressways with loop detector stations at irregular intervals.",

        "abstract": "Traditional statistical crash prediction models oftentimes suffer from poor data quality and require large amount of historical data. In this paper, we propose a crash prediction method based on a bivariate extreme value theory (EVT) framework, considering both drivers\u2019 perception-reaction failure and failure to proper evasive actions. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized to collect videos of ten intersections in Fengxian, China, at representative time periods. High-resolution vehicle trajectory data were extracted by a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) technique, based on four detailed metrics were derived including Time-to-accident (TA), Post-encroachment Time (PET), minimum Time-to-collision (mTTC), and Maximum Deceleration Rate (MaxD). TA was expected to capture the chance of perception-reaction failure, while other three metrics were used to measure the probability of failure to proper evasive actions. Univariate EVT models were applied to obtain marginal crash probability based on each metric. Bivariate EVT models were developed to obtain joint crash probability based on three pairs: TA and mTTC, TA and PET, and TA and MaxD. Thus, union crash probability within observation periods can be derived and the annual crash frequency of each intersection was predicted. The predictions were compared to actual annual crash frequencies, using multiple tests. The findings are three-folds: 1. The best conflict metrics for angle and rear-end crash predictions were different; 2. Bivariate EVT models were found to be superior to univariate models, regarding both angle and rear-end crash predictions; 3. TA appeared to be an important conflict metric that should be considered in a bivariate EVT model framework. In general, the proposed method can be considered as a promising tool for safety evaluation, when crash data are limited.",

        "abstract": "There have been numerous studies on real-time crash prediction seeking to link real-time crash likelihood with traffic and environmental predictors. Nevertheless, none has explored the impact of socio-demographic and trip generation parameters on real-time crash risk. This study analyzed the real-time crash risk for expressway ramps using traffic, geometric, socio-demographic, and trip generation predictors. Two Bayesian logistic regression models were utilized to identify crash precursors and their impact on ramp crash risk. Meanwhile, four Support Vector Machines (SVM) were applied to predict crash occurrence. Bayesian logistic regression models and SVMs commonly showed that the models with the socio-demographic and trip generation variables outperform their counterparts without those parameters. It indicates that the socio-demographic and trip generation parameters have significant impact on the real-time crash risk. The Bayesian logistic regression model results showed that the logarithm of vehicle count, speed, and percentage of home-based-work production had positive impact on crash risk. Meanwhile, off-ramps or non-diamond-ramps experienced higher crash potential than on-ramps or diamond-ramps, respectively. Though the SVMs provided good model performance, the SVM model with all variables (i.e., all traffic, geometric, socio-demographic, and trip generation variables) had an overfitting problem. Therefore, it is recommended to build SVM models based on significant variables identified by other models, such as logistic regression.",

        "abstract": "Real-time crash risk prediction using traffic data collected from loop detector stations is useful in dynamic safety management systems aimed at improving traffic safety through application of proactive safety countermeasures. The major drawback of most of the existing studies is that they focus on the crash risk without consideration of crash severity. This paper presents an effort to develop a model that predicts the crash likelihood at different levels of severity with a particular focus on severe crashes. The crash data and traffic data used in this study were collected on the I-880 freeway in California, United States. This study considers three levels of crash severity: fatal/incapacitating injury crashes (KA), non-incapacitating/possible injury crashes (BC), and property-damage-only crashes (PDO). The sequential logit model was used to link the likelihood of crash occurrences at different severity levels to various traffic flow characteristics derived from detector data. The elasticity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the traffic flow variables on the likelihood of crash and its severity.The results show that the traffic flow characteristics contributing to crash likelihood were quite different at different levels of severity. The PDO crashes were more likely to occur under congested traffic flow conditions with highly variable speed and frequent lane changes, while the KA and BC crashes were more likely to occur under less congested traffic flow conditions. High speed, coupled with a large speed difference between adjacent lanes under uncongested traffic conditions, was found to increase the likelihood of severe crashes (KA). This study applied the 20-fold cross-validation method to estimate the prediction performance of the developed models. The validation results show that the model's crash prediction performance at each severity level was satisfactory. The findings of this study can be used to predict the probabilities of crash at different severity levels, which is valuable knowledge in the pursuit of reducing the risk of severe crashes through the use of dynamic safety management systems on freeways.",

        "abstract": "The real-time conflict prediction model using traffic flow characteristics is much less studied than the crash-based model. This study aims at exploring the relationship between conflicts and traffic flow features with the consideration of heterogeneity and developing predictive models to identify conflict-prone conditions in a real-time manner. The high-resolution trajectory data from the HighD dataset is used as empirical data. A novel method with the virtual detector approach for traffic feature extraction and a two-step framework is proposed for the trajectory data analysis. The framework consists of an exploratory study by random parameter logit model with heterogeneity in means and variances and a comparative study on several machine learning methods, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (Boosting), Random Forest (Bagging), Support Vector Machine (Single-classifier), and Multilayer-Perceptron (Deep neural network). Results indicate that (1) traffic flow characteristics have significant impacts on the probability of conflict occurrence; (2) the statistical model considering mean heterogeneity outperforms the counterpart and lane differences variables are found to significantly impact the means of random parameters for both lane variables and lane differences variables; (3) eXtreme Gradient Boosting trained on an under-sampled dataset turns out to be the best model with the highest AUC of 0.871 and precision of 0.867, showing that re-sampling techniques can significantly improve the model performance. The proposed model is found to be sensitive to the conflict threshold. Sensitivity analysis on feature selection further confirms that the conflict risk prediction should consider both subject lane features and lane difference features, which verifies the consistency with exploratory analysis based on the statistical model. The consistency between statistical models and machine learning methods improves the interpretability of results for the latter one.",
